{
  "citation_analysis": [
    {
      "software": "ToolA",
      "cited": true,
      "reference_ids": ["[2]", "[5]"]
    },
    {
      "software": "LibraryB",
      "cited": false,
      "reference_ids": []
    }
  ]
}

---SPLIT STEP---

### Step 3: Suggest Missing Citations

Based on the citation analysis:

{{STEP2_RESULT}}

Identify all software entries where a citation was not provided. For each of these, suggest a proper citation that could be added to the paper. Provide the citation as a BibTeX entry. You must return only a valid JSON object with no explanation, preamble, or formatting outside the JSON. Do not include markdown formatting (like triple backticks), introductory phrases, or explanations. Just output the JSON object directly. The JSON must be parsable by a standard JSON parser.
{
  "suggested_citations": {
    "LibraryB": "@misc{libraryb2023, title={LibraryB: An Example Tool}, author={Author, A.}, year={2023}, url={https://example.com/libraryb}}"
  }
